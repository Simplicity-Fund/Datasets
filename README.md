# Simplicity Datasets

This repository serves as a central hub for collecting and storing the different datasets used by Simplicity. Currently is storing stock data and news data.

It is organized into two main folders:
* `/scripts`: This folder contains the Python scripts developed to automate the retrieval of stock market data and relevant news articles. The scripts use web scraping techniques to gather up-to-date information from multiple sources, making it easier to access crucial market insights.
* `/data`: This folder holds the output from the scripts in the form of structured datasets. These datasets include the stock prices, trends, and associated news headlines, making them valuable resources for analysis and decision-making.

The repository is designed to help simplify the process of gathering financial and news data, making it accessible for further analysis, machine learning projects, or real-time monitoring.
